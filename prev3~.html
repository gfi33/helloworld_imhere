<h1>About Me</h1>
<img src="../../OneDrive/Pictures/Family Pics/Family Pictures/Family Pose 2.jpg" width="900"height="1100" alt="" style="border: 0" />
<p>"My name is Gregory Fisher and I am a developer who resides in Rowlett, Texas just down the street from Lake Ray Hubbard.
I enjoy spending time with my wife and oure 3 kids. In my spare time I work on planning my business that I am wanting to get
started, which learning programming will help me learn."</p>
<H1>My Background</H1>
<p>"I received my GED in 2012 since I couldn't graduate in 1999 due to back troubles with scoliosis. Shortly after I got out
of High School, I met and married my first wife, who I deeply loved.
We were married for 15 years until one unexpected morning, when she had passed away in her sleep in December of 2014. After I
had my life turned upside down, I had her in my life still and I knew she was watching over me when she had my current wife
come into my life through technology (Somewhat similiar to how I meet my first wife) and my second wife and I just got married
last year in Feburary 2016. I am currently in between jobs but am a stay at home dad now to focus on starting my career in
Website Development. My passion is business. My love is my family. My heart is captured by my wife, my kids and my business."</p>
<h1>Why Programming?</h1>
<p>"I have been working on getting my social commerce website started for the last 6 years and have run into a roadblock of
finding a programmer to come on and be my Technical Co-Founder with me and my cousin, who is my business partner. So I have
always wondered how the whole web programming aspect worked and started to dabble in it, reading books, visting websites like
codeacademy.com and started learning a little on my own and wanted to be able to enjoythe fruit of my labors when I get my
website up and going from all ascpects all by myself"</p>
